# NBDash
NBDash (Namur Budget Dashboard) is an interactive dashboard which allows citizens to understand how the budget is dispatched per function
in the municipality of Namur. A demo of the dashboard is accessible at the following link: https://rb.gy/fsq8d3

## Data Used
NBDash used two main datasets available on the Namur open data portal:
[Namur-Ordinary Budget by function](https://rb.gy/61r8dk) and [Namur-Extraordinary Budget by function](https://rb.gy/dpayws)

## Objective
The dashboard was created to evaluate two facts. First, whether citizens are more receptive to dashboards than to visualizations offered on a traditional OGD portal. Second, whether the implemented dashboard design recommendations help to increase the citizen engagement compared to the existent dashboards on a traditional OGD portal.
