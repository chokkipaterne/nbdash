# NBDash
NBDash (Namur Budget Dashboard) is an interactive dashboard which allows citizens to understand how the budget is dispatched per function
in the municipality of Namur. A demo of the dashboard is accessible at the following link: https://rb.gy/fsq8d3

## Data Used
NBDash used two main datasets available on the Namur open data portal:
[Namur-Ordinary Budget by function](https://rb.gy/61r8dk) and [Namur-Extraordinary Budget by function](https://rb.gy/dpayws)

## Objective
The dashboard was created to evaluate whether citizens are more receptive to well-designed dashboards than to visualizations offered on a traditional Open Government Data portal.
